# creative_code_final
This project is a sound and visual interactive experience. The audio is original and the sound texture is derived from simulating the sound of a public piano (located in Hong Kong) played by a friend's recording, aiming to convey a sense of emotional connection.
The animations in the project are black, white and gray by default, reflecting the visual style of simplicity and abstraction. The main interface contains a horizontal line on which the animation will be displayed. There is a triangle graphic at the bottom of the interface. When the mouse hovers over the triangle, an input box will be displayed. The user can type in any character and press Enter. The character will be transformed into an animation and a small piece of music will be played, which lasts about 3 to 6 seconds and then disappears. Some of the different punctuation marks correspond to different melodies.
After input a number from 0 to 13 and press Enter will play the music of that number.

这个项目是一个声音与视觉互动体验。音频为原创，声音质感来源于模拟由朋友录制的公共钢琴（位于香港）演奏的声音，旨在传达一种情感上的联系感。
项目中的动画默认为黑、白、灰三色，体现简洁与抽象的视觉风格。主界面包含一条横向的线条，动画将在这条线上展示。界面下方有一个三角形图形，当鼠标悬停在三角形上方时，将会显示一个输入框。用户可以输入任何字符并按下 Enter 键，字符将会转化为动画，同时会播放一小段音乐，持续大约 3 到 6 秒后消失。其中有些不同的标点符号对应着不同的旋律。
输入 0 至 13 之间的数字并按 Enter 键后，将播放该数字的音乐。
